There is Wojtek's blog https://ekskursje.pl/ powered by wordpress.
Under posts there are very long discussion in comments, which while being super intereting are hard to follow by readers because coments are diplayed in very long lists (oldest to newest), there is no way to navigate threads. Some comments author quote parts of prevoius posts in usenet manner which makes it bit easier, still not ideal. not every comment author follows same convention.
Readig all conversation takes a lot of time so reades usualy leave and return lather, then may have hard time to figure out when they left.

Act as expert in Front End and User Expierience perform analysis of underlying DOM structure and design a way to present conversation in a maximally user friendly way which will make it easier to navigate threads and know where to pick up reading on return.

Design algorithms which will make best effort to

detect threads structure and reconstuct conversation threads
automatically detect what comments have been seen by reader and use visual features to accent undread comments
Both algorithms should not require user to click in any elemnents, rather that that rely on best algorythmic efforts.

Finally implement prototype app for me to review
